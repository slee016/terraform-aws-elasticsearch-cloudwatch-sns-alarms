Terraform module that configures important elasticsearch alerts using CloudWatch and sends them to an SNS topic.

Create a set of sane Elasticsearch CloudWatch alerts for monitoring the health of an elasticsearch cluster.

`v1.x` supports terraform `v0.12` syntax!

| area       | metric                    | comparison operator | threshold | rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Sharding   | ClusterStatus.red         | `>=`                | 1         | At least one primary shard and its replicas are not allocated to a node for 1 minute 1 consecutive time. Threshold should always be 1.                                                                         |

| Storage    | FreeStorageSpace          | `<=`                | 20480 MB  | A node in your cluster is down to 20 GiB of free storage space for 1 minute 1 consecutive time. This value is in MiB, so rather than 20480, we recommend setting it to 25% of the storage space for each node. |
| Storage    | ClusterIndexWritesBlocked | `>=`                | 1         | The cluster is blocking write requests for 5 minutes 1 consecutive time. Threshold should always be 1.                                                                                                         |

| Snapshot   | AutomatedSnapshotFailure  | `>=`                | 1         | An automated snapshot failed for 1 minute 1 consecutive time. This failure is often the result of a red cluster health status.                                                                                 |

## Examples

See the [`examples/`](examples/) directory for working examples.

```hcl
resource "aws_elasticsearch_domain" "es" {
  domain_name           = "example"
  elasticsearch_version = "6.3"

  cluster_config {
    instance_type = "r4.large.elasticsearch"
  }

  snapshot_options {
    automated_snapshot_start_hour = 23
  }

  tags = {
    Domain = "TestDomain"
  }
}

module "es_alarms" {
  source         = "github::https://github.com/dubiety/terraform-aws-elasticsearch-cloudwatch-sns-alarms.git?ref=master"
  domain_name    = "example"
}
```

You can alternatively have this module not create an SNS incase you have existing ones created elsewhere.

```hcl
module "es_alarms" {
  source           = "github::https://github.com/dubiety/terraform-aws-elasticsearch-cloudwatch-sns-alarms.git?ref=master"
  domain_name      = "example"
  sns_topic        = "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456123456:sns-to-slack"   # < Put your full SNS ARN here, if necessary read from var or a resource
  create_sns_topic = false
}
```
